# Overview
This series is designed to teach you how to create basic neural networks with python and tensorflow 2.0. It will cover everything from basic neural networks trained on MNIST data to convolutional neural networks.

# What Youâ€™ll Learn
This series is packed full of valuable information.
You will learn and understand the following after this tutorial:

* How a Neural Network Works
* How to Design a Neural Network
* How to Train a Neural Network
* How to use a Neural Network to make predicitions
* The different kinds of Neural Networks

# Pre-requisites
This is NOT a beginner tutorial and I will not be teaching python syntax. It is also highly encouraged that you are familiar with Object Orientated Principles

* Intermediate Programming Knowledge
* Experience With Python 3 Syntax
